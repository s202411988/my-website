            <h2>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h2>
            <h3>Developed and published by Nintendo.</h3>
            <h4>Review published Sep 8, 2021.</h4>
            <p>Had a really great time finishing this game! Loved the amount of freedom given to the player. Nintendo really just drop you into Hyrule to explore as you see fit. For the most part, this works great, and lets anyone play the game how they would like to. Conversely, I did find that I got myself into some really tough areas that I clearly was not prepared for, and those times felt somewhat frustrating. Overall I believe it to be a positive, and much prefer that to some more traditional level-gating found in games like the recent Assassin's Creed entries.<br>
            The star of the show to me, in Breath of the Wild, was the world design. Everywhere you travel there is something intriguing that begs you to go check it out. This is aided by putting main quest objectives in the far corners of the map, so as Link finds his way to them, he is constantly discovering new and interesting items, enemies and locations. The map is large, but densely packed with small challenges and rewards, that didn't feel too repetitive until I started getting towards the end game. The numerous fast travel points and various traversal options save it from being tedious to just go where you want to go, which can be a big problem in many open-world games.<br>
            The few issues I have with Breath of the Wild are fairly minor. The soundtrack, usually superb in Zelda games, was quite lacking and sparse. Perhaps thematically it fits with the ruined Hyrule, but I really would have liked more. Combat was serviceable, but I would have enjoyed some more depth using weapons. Alternatives, like rolling boulders down a hill into enemies for example, are great ideas, but far too infrequent and situational to be utilised well. There's also that classic dissonance between narrative and gameplay, where the story requires you to do something quickly, but the player is free to take as much time as they want to actually do it. Not a huge deal, but something to nitpick about.<br>
            In the end, I had a wonderful time playing Breath of the Wild, and was impressed by the sense of freedom, exploration and discovery on offer.</p>

            <h2>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</h2>
            <h3>Developed by Ubisoft Montreal, published by Ubisoft.</h3>
            <h4>Review published Dec 18, 2020.</h4>
            <p>I really struggle to recommend this game. There are plenty of aspects I enjoy about the Assassin's Creed franchise, however with each new release, Ubisoft seem to make changes that directly oppose what I like.<br>
            To start with the positives, I found Assassin's Creed Valhalla to be quite a good looking game in many ways. Character models, weapons and armour, and parts of the map are all well detailed and designed, and look great. The opening in Norway was particularly beautiful. Light filtering through water and foliage looks superb. I also really enjoyed the structure of the game, where sections of the playable area are separated into their own story segments, culminating to a larger narrative climax. The combat is further refined from the previous two games, and is perhaps the best yet in the series. The stamina bar gives it a good balance, and the weapons all feel unique, similar to other action games.<br>
            Unfortunately, there are a lot of problems with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and many mechanics that just do not appeal to me as the series moves further into RPG territory. Firstly, the performance on my PC was abysmal, with dozens of crashes, visual glitches and issues, and a literal game-breaking bug that prevented me from progressing the storyline. I feel this game's release was incredibly rushed to be out in time for the new console launches.<br>
            Narratively, AC Valhalla is a mixed bag. Some of the individual location story arcs are well written and compelling, but there are sections that make absolutely no sense, with muddled character motivations and incomprehensible writing. I struggled to connect with the player character, when, for example, I would have liked to behave in a certain way, but the character decides to act completely against their brother when, up until this point, they have been entirely loyal. It doesn't make sense, and it's clearly done to force a narrative direction, despite there being so much emphasis on how the player's decision making affects the story.<br>
            Overall I found the game to have a solid foundation, but far too many technical and subjective problems to really get a good time out of.</p>

            <h2>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</h2>
            <h3>Developed and published by Nintendo.</h3>
            <h4>Review published Mar 10, 2021.</h4>
            <p>This is a fantastic entry in the Super Mario franchise, with 3D World being a game of shorter, course-clear style levels, and Bowser's Fury being a single large explorable area. Each game does an incredible job of showcasing what made the Mario series excel in the first place - solid platforming and excellent level design.<br>
            Just about every course in 3D World introduces a specific mechanic or gameplay element that gets expanded upon as the player continues through each level, and the game as a whole. The amount of variety and new ideas shown as you progress though the worlds is astounding, and when they are brought back later in more challenging ways, completing them gives the player such a great sense of satisfaction.<br>
            Bowser's Fury is a perfect way of utilising the skills picked up from 3D World and putting them to use in a large map filled with brilliant level design. The unlocked camera, opposed to 3D World's much less flexible counterpart, gives the developers freedom to create more fun and interesting platforming, however I feel it falls a bit short of the superb kingdoms featured in Super Mario Odyssey. Unfortunately, Bowser's Fury is only a brief experience too. I managed to complete it in just one day, and I would have loved to see more of these open environments with the 3D World mechanics.<br>
            My main criticism mainly falls to the price tag. This is a full priced Switch game, but the bulk of the content is an almost unchanged port of a Wii U game. Had Bowser's Fury been released as a standalone title, with a suitably lower cost, it would have been a lot more palatable. I also found Bowser's Fury to occasionally have some very severe frame rate drops, but aside from that, I don't have many complaints.<br>
            Overall, I can definitely recommend Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury for anyone who has not already played 3D World, or is happy to pay the full amount. Bowser's Fury is a great little package for those who are keen on some new Mario platforming action. Both entries highlight the great strengths of the Mario series, and deserve a playthough from anyone interested.</p>

            <h2>Firewatch</h2>
            <h3>Developed by Campo Santo, published by Campo Santo and Panic.</h3>
            <h4>Review published Jan 3, 2021.</h4>
            <p>This was a pleasant little adventure which only took about 4 hours or so to finish. It's incredible how well I was able to connect with the two lead characters in that small amount of time, thanks to the fantastic dialogue and great performances on behalf of the actors. Though, when the game boils down to little more than walking and talking, you'd better hope it does them well.<br>
            The plot of the game was quite interesting, but the ending was ultimately unsatisfying. Thankfully it mainly serves as just the backdrop for character interactions.<br>
            The beautiful art direction and soundtrack are a benefit to make up for Firewatch's short length, barebones story, and simple gameplay mechanics, but consequently do not save the game from being much more than just a good little experience.</p>

            <h2>New Super Mario Bros. U</h2>
            <h3>Developed and published by Nintendo.</h3>
            <h4>Review published Jun 28, 2021.</h4>
            <p>I've been playing this game on and off for quite a few months, finishing some levels here and there, but recently got around to completing it.<br>
            This is a 2D Mario game. That's all you need to hear to know you will be getting a solid experience playing New Super Mario Bros. U. There's honestly not that much I can say about it that everyone doesn't already know! The stages are well designed with a decent amount of variety in their visual identity, and a good difficulty curve as you progress through. The music is fun and boppy but I found it a bit repetitive towards the endgame.<br>
            I did have a bit of trouble with precise movement while playing, not sure if it was perhaps a bit of input lag, how the game is intended to be, or maybe I just wasn't skilled enough! I found it much better playing as Toadette, who has more traction than other characters, and of course the Super Crown power-up which turns her into Peachette. There are less movement options in NSMBU compared to the 3D Mario games on Switch - Super Mario Odyssey and Bowser's Fury - and I found it limiting when trying to make my way through levels.<br>
            I'm not a big fan of the overall aesthetic of the NSMB games either. There's something so charming about the 2D sprites featured in the classic Mario games that is missing from these newer sidescrollers. In the end, I did have an ok time playing New Super Mario Bros. U, but I got frustrated too often for me to really enjoy it.</p>

            <h2>Inside</h2>
            <h3>Developed and published by Playdead.</h3>
            <h4>Review published Aug 17, 2020.</h4>
            <p>This game is a fantastic little experience, with its brilliant minimalist sound design and art style. There is a section where the soundtrack synchronises perfectly with the diegetic noise in the world of the game that is just superb. The animations are highly detailed, and excel thanks to the simplistic graphic design.<br>
            Gameplay is a fairly standard for a puzzle/platformer, though it is done cleverly, with nothing that should leave you scratching your head for too long. There is a good progression to the elements introduced that flow on from one another.<br>
            There is no dialogue in the game, so the plot is unravelled entirely through visual storytelling and the areas you play though. It is intriguing and compelling right throughout the game, with a fascinating ending. Along with their previous game, Limbo, Playdead's Inside is a wonderful affair that only takes a few hours to finish, and comes highly recommended from me.</p>

            <h2>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</h2>
            <h3>Developed by Respawn Entertainment, published by Electronic Arts.</h3>
            <h4>Review published Aug 15, 2020.</h4>
            <p>Most likable in this game was the music and graphics. The soundtrack fits in well with the Star Wars franchise, taking its influence from John Williams' legendary film scores. The worlds visited are vibrant and rich with detail. Level design was large and sprawling, if sometimes not the most intuitive to traverse. Character and creature designs are imaginative and well done, although the player customisation options were somewhat underwhelming. Unfortunately the experience was hampered by a myriad of technical issues. Performance was patchy, with frame rates all over the place, and minor bugs and glitches were found everywhere.<br>
            While a mix between Dark Souls and Uncharted sounds incredible on paper, Fallen Order unfortunately only takes the most basic of their respective elements, and slaps a Star Wars coloured coat of paint on them. The gameplay was, for the most part successful, but it never really surpassed adequacy. Combat didn't have the flow and finesse of similar narrative driven action-adventure games such as God of War, or the Batman Arkham series. Platforming was often janky and unreliable, though at least it provided a few laughs.<br>
            The story was serviceable, but I had trouble caring about a lot of the characters and their backgrounds or goals. Some plot lines felt underdeveloped and rushed causing dialogue to seem out of character occasionally. The game lasts about 15-20 hours, which is somewhat on the shorter side for its genre, but that's probably preferable than it outstaying its welcome.<br>
            Ultimately, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order felt like it checked all the boxes of a standard action-adventure game, but lacked the kind of polish you get from a more experienced studio. Hopefully Respawn Entertainment get more opportunities to work on these sorts of games in the future, and can improve upon this solid foundation.</p>

            <h2>The Last of Us Part II</h2>
            <h3>Developed by Naughty Dog, published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.</h3>
            <h4>Review published Aug 8, 2020.</h4>
            <p>From a presentation standpoint, this is the most impressive game I have ever played. The cutscenes are astounding, the landscapes are breathtaking, and the locations you play through are so sprawling and well designed. The attention to detail throughout every worn down house, every overgrown street is unbelievable. Gustavo Santaolalla's soundtrack is moving and evocative. The sounds of gunshots and explosions from the war, or screeches and clicks from the infected ring out around you, perfectly setting the atmosphere for different sections of the game. The audio and visuals offered really show off what video games can achieve.<br>
            Gameplay is almost identical to the first game, just refined. Some new traversal options are introduced, but it generally sticks to the formula of exploration and travel interspersed with combat encounters. There are some stunning set pieces, yet perhaps a little over the top, for what is mostly an ultra-realistic, grounded story. Action segments are great. Stealth is slow, but rewarding, and gunplay is punchy and powerful. You can feel the kickback of each rifle shot, the heat from a molotov cocktail. Enemies are disposed of in horrific detail. While not bringing anything particularly new in terms of gameplay, the game does its job well.<br>
            The story is bleak, with death and loss everywhere. Loss of life, loss of family. Loss of self. Dialogue is well written and natural, excellently performed by the voice actors. It was a little harder to empathise with newer characters that are only given a fraction of the time to spend with, compared to Joel and Ellie from the first game. The introduction of these characters also predisposes them in a negative light. This self-imposed hurdle from Naughty Dog actually makes it impressive that you start to care for these characters at all, but ultimately it fell flat. Some of the supporting cast felt underdeveloped though, and used purely as plot devices. Pacing was staggered with an abundance of flashbacks, particularly in the mid-late part of the game. Overall, I thought the game was very good, and exceptionally well made.</p>
